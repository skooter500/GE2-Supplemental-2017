Description:
-	There are 10 “traffic lights” arranged in a circle of radius 10 centred around the origin (0,0,0). 
-	Each traffic light cycles through green, yellow and red and then back to green again. Traffic lights stay green for a random time of between 5 and 10 seconds. 
-	Traffic lights go yellow for exactly 4 seconds always. 
-	Traffic lights stay red for a random time of between 5 and 10 seconds and then go back to green again. 
-	When the program starts, each traffic light is set to be red, yellow or green randomly. 
-	The purple “car” picks a green traffic light to go to at random. 
-	It should only ever go to a green traffic light.  
-	When it arrives at a green traffic light it should pick another green traffic light to arrive at. 
-	If the traffic light it's heading for turns yellow or red when it's on the way, it should pick a different traffic light to go to.
